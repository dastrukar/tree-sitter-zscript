# ZScript (GZDoom) grammar for Tree-sitter

This is my first attempt at making a grammar for tree-sitter, so apologies if there's some weird inconsistencies.
Feel free to correct me through issues/PRs :]

I made this because there doesn't seem to be any ZScript grammar for Tree-sitter, I've been using the C-Sharp grammar but it doesn't seem to work well with some syntaxes.
If there's a better version out there, let me know and I can stop working on this lol.
Also, feel free to suggest anything that I missed out on, or better yet, make a PR to implement the stuff I missed out on :]
